    <p>Hey {first_name},</p>
    <p>
      Hope you're doing great! I wanted to introduce you to an energy digital twin platform of ASU that I've been developing over the past year. It's designed to empower staff and faculty to cut down energy waste and optimize campus resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some insights from a survey I conducted in April 2024 (163 responses across the U.S.):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>75% of IT Professionals</strong> believe a digital twin platform would have a positive impact on achieving sustainability goals in their workplace.</li>
      <li><strong>62% of Students</strong> are unsure of where or how to access energy usage data in their school or workplace, highlighting a major awareness gap.</li>
      <li><strong>35% of Students</strong> say they would regularly use a digital twin platform to optimize energy use—even without external incentives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I'd love your help in getting this platform to the next level—real-time functionality. For this to happen, we'll need buy-in from higher-ups to integrate the necessary infrastructure. Could you help champion this idea or share thoughts on how we might make the case?
    </p>

      Here's a link to skip the signup page and explore the demo:

    <p>
      If you have feedback, ideas for features, or see potential for scaling, I'd be excited to chat!
